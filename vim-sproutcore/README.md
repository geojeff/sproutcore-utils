Introduction
============

vim-sproutcore is a set of files for using vim with Sproutcore (javascript) files.

I've started with configuration for snipMate, a plugin for using TextMate snippets
in vim. The file sproutcore.snippets was generated by a python script which I put
in the Snippets directory of the [sproutcore-tmbundle](http://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore-tmbundle).  Running 
python concat_snippets.py will concatenate all .tmbundle files to sproutcore.snippets,
putting the snippet keyword in front of the name of the snippet, which is taken as
the filename (button.tmbundle becomes button), and emitting the lines of the snippet
with hard-tabs at the beginning of each line. I then moved sproutcore.snippets to my
~/.vim/snippets directory.

I didn't figure out how to make vim, or mvim, work by just putting sproutcore.snippets
in my ~/.vim/snippets directory. I tried to do :set ft=sproutcore.javascript in a test
file, but couldn't get the button snippet to fire as a test. So, currently, I have simply
appended the contents of sproutcore.snippet to my existing javascript.snippet file,
and with the .js extension used for sproutcore files, it works. This might not 
work for everyone.

I'll update as I test...
